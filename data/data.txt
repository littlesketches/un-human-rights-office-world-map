For the most part, the Human Rights Council is accessible for persons with visual impairment. However, some improvements need to be made to better adapt the inscription process so that it is accessible to all.Thanks to the LDCs/SIDS Trust Fund, Antigua and Barbuda was afforded the maiden opportunity to participate in this session and to be part of the historic joint statement.

The human rights element is constantly at the forefront of my mind when considering policies, procedures and as a result, it is re-shaping the discussions and conversations. The re-structuring and re-shaping of the discussions and conversations will in turn lead to the review and amendment of policies, procedures and approaches. While this may not be considered as a concrete action, this change in approach is monumental in that it requires the application of a human rights-based approach to begin and concretize action."	fellowship2015BS.png			Bosnia and Herzegovina	BIH	BA	Europe	Southern Europe																																June-July 2015						September-October 2015						February-March 2016						June-July 2016						September 2016						February-March 2017						June-2017																Belarus	BLR	BY	Europe	Eastern Europe																																June-July 2015						September-October 2015						February-March 2016						June-July 2016						September 2016						February-March 2017						June-2017																Belize	BLZ	BZ	Americas	Central America		New York		sids			beneficiary	32th Session (June 2016)	hrcSession	hrc32	Thank you from Belize!	tba	hrc32	Yes																		June-July 2015						September-October 2015						February-March 2016	Female	Orla Kantun-Coleman	"Director of Cooperation and Treaty Reporting, Ministry of Foreign Affairs"	"I never would have imagined that participating in one Human Rights Council session would have enriched my professional career so much. I was really able to hone my understanding of the Human Rights Council procedures and mechanisms and it was as though I was filling in the gaps as I moved from theory to practical application.My time at the HRC also made its work more real and it evolved from being a foreign construct to something that I could actually relate to, understand and participate in. Also, being in that environment and having other Member States approach me for Belize's support on various resolutions helped me to better appreciate and understand the dynamics of the HRC's work in Geneva.My objective now is to see how best to fully integrate human rights into Belize's national policy framework and to recognize that treaty reporting is only a means to an end. Overall, it was a truly enriching experience and surpassed my expectations of the added value that I would walk away with. It was truly a job well done in delivering technical assistance and building the capacity in human rights for LDCs/SIDS."

Evelyn Khan	"Legal Adviser & Technical Coordinator, Governance Office, Office of the Prime Minister and First Vice President"	"The opportunity to participate in the thirty-second regular session of the Human Rights Council and engage in its work was invaluable from any vantage point.Of particular note and value was the alignment/collaboration of the LDCs/SIDS to forge one common voice on the issue of realizing the right to development in the particular context of these Member States. The Trust Fund was certainly the unifying agent and catalyst for this sounding of one voice; both in its spirit and intention.The authentic opportunity for wider networking with stronger, more developed countries is also significant and a direct result of the efforts of the HRC and the Trust Fund. Learning from other Member States, both developed and developing, allows for enormous growth.To give every State a voice in the global arena and facilitate the sharing of ideas, problems and solutions are among the highest ideals of the Council. The realization of these ideals by way of the Trust Fund is a significant victory and there is no question that Guyana and its fellow LDCs/SIDS will stand taller and remain more informed because of it."

I am a key person in the Ministry with responsibility for establishing a NHRI in Jamaica and I have been tasked with assisting in its establishment."		September-October 2015						February-March 2016						June-July 2016						September 2016	Female	Shae-Alicia Lewis	Acting Assistant Director International Organizations Department Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade	"My participation in the pre-session induction programme and in the thirty-fourth session of the Human Rights Council, courtesy of the LDCs/SIDS Trust Fund, was a very rewarding professional and personal experience. First, the induction programme, along with the e-Learning course, provided a very useful and comprehensive overview of the work of the Human Rights Council. Second, participation in the thirty-fourth session of the Council was enriching and significantly contributed to my professional development. I am sincerely grateful for the opportunity to have experienced a session of the Human Rights Council in person and to have observed the dynamics between Member States and between Member States and non-governmental organizations. This immersion enabled me to better appreciate the complexity of the work of the Council and, by extension, of the global human rights agenda.Nonetheless, my participation in the thirty-fourth session of the Human Rights Council was not only for my benefit. There is no doubt that Jamaica as a whole benefited from the support I was able to provide to my permanent mission in the analysis of resolutions, consultations with the capital, the monitoring of resolutions, the drafting of interventions, reporting and follow-up. I was proud to have been designated by my fellow Beneficiary Delegates to speak on their behalf on the occasion of the launch of the Trust Fund's brochure commemorating its fifth anniversary.My presence in Geneva also enabled my country to successfully juggle its participation in the substantive work of the Council with its coordination of human rights matters for the Latin American and Caribbean Group. For a small country with a small permanent mission, having reinforcement during a session of the Council, with its multitude of simultaneous activities, is quite valuable. Going forward, I expect that the knowledge I gained through this experience will better equip me to support my country's participation in future sessions of the Human Rights Council, particularly given my improved understanding of timelines, thematic areas and Member State policy positions. My experience will also serve to enhance the soundness of policy advice on the multilateral human rights discourse that I may be required to provide to my Ministry and other government ministries, departments and agencies. For this reason, I consider that the LDCs/SIDS Trust Fund is a valuable capacity-building tool for Small Island Developing States like Jamaica."

This fact was reaffirmed for me after undergoing two days of accelerated learning regarding the multilateral human rights system, followed by focused practical training related to the working methods of the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms while also learning how to overcome jetlag. Having the experience of sitting through and participating in the general debates and interactive dialogues taught me to see both sides of an issue, think critically, speak confidently and differentiate a strong argument from strong rhetoric.On an intellectual level, HRC32 exposed me to a wide variety of human rights discourses, issues and resources that I would otherwise never have considered. I also developed quite a few diplomatic skills that I will seek to strengthen in the near future."		June-July 2016						September 2016						February-March 2017						June-2017																St. Lucia	LCA	LC	Americas	Caribbean		Paris		sids	island		beneficiary	Fellowship 2015 (Sep-Nov)	fellowship	fellowship2015	Thank you from St. Lucia!

In 2014, my dream came true when I was able to participate in the work of the Human Rights Council. Addressing the session of the Human Rights Council on behalf of my country on issues related to water and sanitation was a milestone in my life. I consider this experience to be one of my greatest achievements because the voice of my country, one of the LDCs/SIDS, has been heard.In reporting for the follow-up of the Universal Periodic Review recommendations for Suriname, my assistance in the preparation and development of the report was essential. That experience in the Human Rights Council led to an additional request for my assistance with the coordination of our periodic report to the Human Rights Committee, which subsequently resulted in my participation as a member of the delegation to present the periodic report of Suriname to the Human Rights Committee in 2015. In closing, I wish to mention that the creation of the LDCs/SIDS Trust Fund is a way to provide representatives of the LDCs/SIDS with an opportunity to improve their capacity by participating in the work of the Human Rights Council, especially for Member States without representation in Geneva."""

It was very helpful. National dress day was the most fun that I'd had in ages. I love cultural activities and this magnificent day was a way to express our cultures. On top of that, Suriname and Montenegro jointly won the prize for ""best dressed female delegate"" which was icing on the cake.The interaction with other representatives was very fruitful. The countries all wanted to know who the Ônew face' was and who the person was that was sitting in the Ôalways empty' chair. I even had to Ôfight' for my chair on the first day.Since I love writing statements, my Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed that I draft a joint statement on agenda item 6 on behalf of the SIDS, taking into account our obligations, reports and commitments and our need for technical assistance as small countries.Besides the work and learning tools, there was an exchange of views among us which required us to confront our different cultures. It gave us insights about each other's work, beliefs, experiences, countries and islands and of course, our individuality. We made friends but also created a family through SIDS and I will cherish that always."

I was immediately taken to my mission to meet with my colleagues and I received an initial briefing on my role as a delegate representing Trinidad and Tobago at the Council.Over the next two days, I participated in an induction course created by the Trust Fund Secretariat. The induction course provided a good, holistic briefing on how the Human Rights Council operates in practice and how different groups of stakeholders may be involved in the process. I had an opportunity to observe the constructive dialogue process when a representative of one of the Small Island Developing States  engaged with the Committee of Experts for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. During the Council session, I met with various special procedures and learned more about their work when they undertake a country visit. This was extremely helpful as it placed me in a better position to advise my Government about which special procedures we should invite to visit Trinidad and Tobago. Beneficiary Delegates of the Trust Fund were given the opportunity to attend various social events that were hosted by some of the permanent missions. These functions allowed for professional networking which may be beneficial for Trinidad and Tobago in the future. Other side events that were hosted by NGOs or even preliminary debates on resolutions, which were later brought before the Council, proved to be very positive learning experiences for me.On a personal note, the opportunity to work within my area of expertise, particularly in such a different environment and on an international scale, was exceptional. This experience has significantly changed my perspective on human rights reporting. I now have such a clear view of the international impact that reporting can have for a Small Island Developing State; like my own country. This fresh outlook will have a trickle-down effect and ultimately benefit me professionally as well as my country."
